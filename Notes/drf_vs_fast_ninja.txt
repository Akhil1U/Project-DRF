✅ FastAPI

Modern async framework built on Starlette and Pydantic

Designed for performance, type safety, and async from the ground up

No Django features like ORM, templates, sessions, etc.

✅ Django REST Framework (DRF)

The standard for building REST APIs in Django

Feature-rich: permissions, pagination, serializers, viewsets

Synchronous by design, not built for async

✅ Django Ninja

Modern API framework built on top of Django

Uses Pydantic like FastAPI for validation & schema

Full async support and integrates seamlessly with Django ORM and features
